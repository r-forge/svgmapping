Description: This package allows you to display experiment data on a custom-made SVG image. For example, you can to create an image showing a cellular mechanism with the relevant genes displayed as circles, and use this package to color them according to their expression in a microarray experiment. Other features based on the same idea are also provided, like drawing pie charts showing several conditions and a javascript-based window showing gene (or whatever else you display) description.
